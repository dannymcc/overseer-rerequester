## 📦 Installation

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dannymcc/overseer-rerequester.git
   cd overseer-rerequester
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure the script:**
   
   ⚠️ **Important:** The script contains placeholder values. You must update these with your actual Overseer details:
   
   Edit the top of `overseer_rerequest.py` to set your Overseer details:
   
   ```python
   # Configuration - Update these values for your setup
   OVERSEER_URL = "https://your-overseer-instance.com"
   API_TOKEN = "your-api-token-here"
   
   # Set to True to actually re-request items (USE WITH CAUTION!)
   DRY_RUN = True
   
   # Skip confirmation prompt in live mode (USE WITH CAUTION!)
   SKIP_CONFIRMATION = False
   
   # Request throttling - delay in seconds between requests
   REQUEST_DELAY = 1.0
   
   # For testing - limit number of requests (set to None for no limit)
   TEST_LIMIT = None
   
   # Optional filtering (set to None to disable)
   FILTER_BEFORE_DATE = None   # Example: "2024-12-31"
   FILTER_AFTER_DATE = None    # Example: "2024-01-01"
   FILTER_MEDIA_TYPE = None    # Example: "movie" or "tv"
   FILTER_BY_USER = None       # Example: "username" or 123
   FILTER_ONLY_MISSING_IN_SERVICES = False # Only re-request items missing from Radarr/Sonarr
   INCLUDE_INVALID_DATES = True # Include requests with missing dates
   ```

4. **Get your API token:**
   - Log into your Overseer instance
   - Go to Settings → General → API Key
   - Copy the API key

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Active Overseer instance
- Valid API token with request permissions
- Network access to your Overseer server

## Filtering Options

The script supports powerful filtering to help you selectively re-request items:

### 📅 **Date Filtering**
Filter requests by date range:

```python
FILTER_BEFORE_DATE = "2024-12-31"  # Only requests before this date
FILTER_AFTER_DATE = "2024-01-01"   # Only requests after this date
# Combine both for a date range (Jan 1 - Dec 31, 2024)
```

**Use cases:**
- Migrate only requests from a specific time period
- Exclude recent requests that might already be processing
- Re-request items from before your server migration
- Process requests in chronological batches

**Date Handling:**
- Requests with missing/invalid dates are included by default
- Set `INCLUDE_INVALID_DATES = False` to exclude them

### 👤 **User Filtering**
Only re-request items from specific users:

```python
FILTER_BY_USER = "username"           # By display name
FILTER_BY_USER = 123                  # By user ID
FILTER_BY_USER = "user@example.com"   # By email address
```

**Use cases:**
- Only re-request items from specific family members
- Re-request items from users who had issues
- Exclude admin test requests

### 🎬 **Media Type Filtering**
Only re-request specific types of content:

```python
FILTER_MEDIA_TYPE = "movie"  # Only movies
FILTER_MEDIA_TYPE = "tv"     # Only TV shows
FILTER_MEDIA_TYPE = None     # Both movies and TV (default)
```

**Use cases:**
- Migrate movies and TV shows separately
- Test migration with only one content type first
- Different handling for movies vs TV series

### 📡 **Service Presence Filtering**
Only re-request items that do not exist in your Radarr/Sonarr services (i.e., their external service IDs are not yet synced or are missing):

```python
FILTER_ONLY_MISSING_IN_SERVICES = True  # Only re-request items missing in Radarr/Sonarr
```

### 🔗 **Combined Filtering**
You can combine multiple filters:

```python
FILTER_AFTER_DATE = "2024-01-01"
FILTER_BEFORE_DATE = "2024-12-01"
FILTER_MEDIA_TYPE = "movie"
FILTER_BY_USER = "username"
# Only movies requested by username between Jan-Dec 2024
```

## 🎯 Usage

### Step 1: Test Connection (Dry Run)

First, run the script in dry run mode to make sure everything works:

```bash
# On most systems:
python overseer_rerequest.py

# On macOS, you may need to use python3:
python3 overseer_rerequest.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Test your connection to Overseer
- 📊 Show you statistics about your requests
- 🔍 Display sample requests
- 💭 Simulate re-requesting without actually doing it

### Step 2: Live Re-requesting (Optional)

⚠️ **CAUTION:** Only do this when you're ready to actually re-request items!

1. Change `DRY_RUN = False` in the script
2. Run the script again:
   ```bash
   # On most systems:
   python overseer_rerequest.py
   
   # On macOS, you may need to use python3:
   python3 overseer_rerequest.py
   ```
3. Confirm when prompted that you want to proceed

## 📋 What This Script Does

1. **Connects** to your Overseer instance using the API
2. **Fetches** all requests (movies, TV shows, etc.)
3. **Analyzes** the requests and shows you statistics
4. **Re-requests** each item, which should trigger your download clients

## 🔒 Security Notes

- 🔐 **Your API token is sensitive** - don't share it publicly or commit it to version control
- 🛡️ The script defaults to dry run mode for safety
- 📝 Review the output carefully before enabling live mode
- 🔒 **For public repositories:** Create a `.env` file or use environment variables for credentials

## ⚡ Advanced Features

### 🔍 **Debug Mode**
To see the detailed structure of requests (useful for troubleshooting):

```python
DEBUG_SHOW_REQUEST_STRUCTURE = True
```

This will show you the complete JSON structure of requests, which can help you understand what data is available.

### ⚡ **Performance & Reliability**
The script includes several features to ensure reliable operation:

- **Request throttling** - Configurable delay between requests to avoid API overload
- **Enhanced error handling** - Detailed error messages with specific failure reasons
- **Progress tracking** - Shows "Processing X/Y" during execution
- **Automatic retries** - Handles temporary API issues gracefully

### 🧪 **Testing Options**
For safe testing and incremental migration:

```python
TEST_LIMIT = 10           # Process only first 10 requests
SKIP_CONFIRMATION = True  # Skip "yes/no" prompts for automation
REQUEST_DELAY = 2.0       # Increase delay for slower API responses
```

### 📊 **Enhanced Analysis**
The script automatically shows:
- **User breakdown** - who made the most requests
- **Date patterns** - requests by month to understand usage trends
- **Detailed sample requests** - with user and date information
- **Success/failure rates** - Track migration effectiveness

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Verify your `OVERSEER_URL` is correct (include `https://`)
- Check that your API token is valid
- Ensure your Overseer instance is accessible

### No Requests Found
- Check that you have requests in your Overseer instance
- Verify your API token has the correct permissions
- Try enabling debug mode to see the raw data structure

### Filtering Issues
- **Date format**: Use YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., "2024-12-31")
- **User matching**: The script checks display name, email, and user ID
- **No matches**: Check the user analysis section to see available users
- **Missing dates**: Old requests may have invalid dates - enable `INCLUDE_INVALID_DATES = True`
- **Media types**: Use exact values "movie" or "tv" (case-insensitive)

### Re-request Failures
- Some items might already be requested/available
- Check your Overseer logs for more details
- Ensure your download clients are properly configured

### Expected Failure Rates
During migration, it's normal to see some failures:
- **TMDB 404 errors**: Old items removed from The Movie Database
- **Data corruption errors**: Invalid metadata in Overseer database
- **Success rates of 40-60%** are typical for older request libraries
- Failed requests usually represent items that needed cleanup anyway
